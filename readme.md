FlatJNI
===========

**FlatJNI** frees you from the troublesome JNI programming, which automatically generates NDK templates based on flatbuffers' schame files for easy integration into Android projects. Just like using flatbuffers, call C ++ functions in Java, so you do not need to take the time to study the JNI specification,and not to write error-prone JNI-related code.
